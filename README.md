# Banker
exemplifies an algorithm for deadlock avoidance.
this program uses two-dimentional arrays to simulate 
a set of three resources that have several instance throughout 5 processes.
This program cycles through each process to determine which processes will not need more resources than what is available at it's time of execution. The program will then print out the sequence of processes that makes up the safe sequence. By doing this, the system can avoid a deadlock.
